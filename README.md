# Telegram NFT Smart Money Alert Bot

A production-ready Telegram bot and web console that tracks NFT minting and purchase activity by wallets organized into user-defined groups, using OpenSea API v2 as the primary data source and SQLite for local, persistent storage.

Built with **Node.js 22 LTS**, **TypeScript**, **Telegraf**, and **Express/React**. Designed for instant deployment on **Botkeep Cloud**.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Accurate NFT Activity Detection**
   - **Genuine Mints**: Filters for events where `from_address` is the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) or explicit `event_type === 'mint'`, with the recipient being a tracked wallet. Excludes ordinary transfers between non-zero addresses.
   - **Confirmed Purchases**: Detects sales where the tracked wallet is the confirmed **buyer**. Excludes sales where the wallet was the seller, and excludes listings, offers, bids, cancellations, or ordinary transfers.
   - **Deduplication Engine**: Records unique event identifiers in SQLite to eliminate duplicate alerts across retrieval cycles.

2. **Accurate Multi-Group Statistics & Deduplication**
   - Tracked wallets can belong to **multiple groups** (e.g. *Alpha*, *Whales*, *Smart Money*).
   - If wallets from multiple groups participate in minting/buying from the same collection on the same chain, they are consolidated into **one clean, unified alert**.
   - **No Double-Counting**: If Wallet A belongs to both *Alpha* and *Whales*, it is counted only **once** in `Total: Unique Wallets`, and its minted NFTs are counted only **once** in `Total: NFTs Minted`.

3. **Required Alert Formats**

   **Mint Alert:**

## ⛓️ Supported Chains & OpenSea API v2 Limitations

Chains are discovered dynamically using the official endpoint:
`GET https://api.opensea.io/api/v2/chains`

### Supported & Actively Monitored Chains:
| Chain | Slug | Identifier | Account Activity Endpoint | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ethereum** | `ethereum` | `ethereum` | Supported (`/events/accounts/{address}`) | 🟢 Actively Monitored |
| **Base** | `base` | `base` | Supported (`/events/accounts/{address}`) | 🟢 Actively Monitored |
| **Polygon** | `polygon` | `matic` | Supported (`/events/accounts/{address}`) | 🟢 Actively Monitored |
| **Arbitrum** | `arbitrum` | `arbitrum` | Supported (`/events/accounts/{address}`) | 🟢 Actively Monitored |
| **Optimism** | `optimism` | `optimism` | Supported (`/events/accounts/{address}`) | 🟢 Actively Monitored |
| **Blast** | `blast` | `blast` | Supported (`/events/accounts/{address}`) | 🟢 Actively Monitored |
| **Zora** | `zora` | `zora` | Supported (`/events/accounts/{address}`) | 🟢 Actively Monitored |
| **Avalanche** | `avalanche` | `avalanche` | Supported (`/events/accounts/{address}`) | 🟢 Actively Monitored |
| **Sei** | `sei` | `sei` | Supported | ⚪ Supported |
| **Ronin** | `ronin` | `ronin` | Supported | ⚪ Supported |
| **Solana** | `solana` | `solana` | Partial v2 activity support | ⚠️ Limited (EVM prioritized) |
| **Flow** | `flow` | `flow` | Cadence / Flow EVM | ⚪ Supported |

### Known OpenSea API Limitations & Safeguards:
1. **Rate Limits (HTTP 429)**: Free/public OpenSea tiers enforce request limits. The service handles rate limits with exponential backoff and automatically respects the `Retry-After` header.
2. **Account Events Latency**: OpenSea indexes on-chain transactions with a 15–45 second delay. The polling cycle is configured to 10 seconds by default (`POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=10`).
3. **Missing Social Metadata**: If a collection has not linked Twitter, Discord, or Website on OpenSea, the bot gracefully falls back to `🌐 Socials: None listed` without failing alert delivery.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Botkeep Cloud Deployment

Botkeep Cloud is designed for 24/7 background bots. Follow these steps to deploy:

### Step 1: Environment Variables Configuration
In the Botkeep dashboard, set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Telegram bot token from @BotFather
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ_example

# Authorized admin user IDs (comma-separated; message @userinfobot to get your ID)
TELEGRAM_ADMIN_IDS=123456789

# OpenSea API v2 Key (from https://docs.opensea.io)
OPENSEA_API_KEY=your_opensea_api_key_here

# Persistent SQLite database location on Botkeep persistent storage
DATABASE_PATH=/data/nft_bot.sqlite

# Polling frequency in seconds (default: 10)
POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=10
```

### Step 2: Persistent Volume Mount
1. Go to your Botkeep service settings under **Volumes / Storage**.
2. Mount a persistent disk volume to `/data`.
3. Set `DATABASE_PATH=/data/nft_bot.sqlite`. This ensures that all wallets, groups, event deduplication history, and collection caches survive container redeployments and restarts.

### Step 3: Deployment Options
- **Option A (Pure Background Bot - Telegraf Long Polling)**:
  - Command: `npm run start:bot`
  - Runs Telegraf long polling and background OpenSea monitoring. Does not require opening any public web ports.
- **Option B (Full-Stack Bot + Web Operator Console)**:
  - Command: `npm start`
  - Runs the Web Console on port 3000 alongside the background Telegram bot and monitor service.
